<h1>Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>
In this lab, I analyze network traffic to and from Azure virtual machines using Wireshark and experiment with network security groups. <br />



<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop Connection
- Command-Line Tools
- Various Network Protocols (SSH, RDH, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 Pro (21H2)
- Ubuntu Server 20.04

<h2>The Set-Up</h2>

In Azure, I created two VMs within the same virtual network for intercommunication: one running Windows 10 Pro and the other Ubuntu. The Windows VM will connect to the Ubuntu VM using the command line/PowerShell. 

<h2>Actions and Observations</h2>

<p>
Using Remote Desktop Connection, I connect to the Windows VM using its public IP address. From there, I installed Wireshark in order to begin inspecting traffic.

<p>

In Wireshark, I filtered for ICMP traffic and used PowerShell to execute the ping command, which utilizes ICMP for network communication issues. I tested connectivity with the Ubuntu VM's private IP address and with google.com. Then, I performed a perpetual ping to the Ubuntu VM using the command: ping -t (IP address) to observe how network security groups function.

<p>
In the Azure portal, I accessed the networking settings for the Ubuntu VM and added an inbound security rule to block ICMP traffic, setting its priority higher than SSH (300) to ensure it applies first.

<p>

Back on the Windows VM, I confirmed that ICMP traffic is blocked due to the inbound security rule. After changing the rule to allow traffic again, the perpetual ping successfully resolves without timing out.

<p>
Next, I examined SSH traffic by logging into the Ubuntu server via PowerShell using the ssh command. In Wireshark, I filtered the traffic with tcp.port == 22. My session is recorded in Wireshark, capturing each command I execute while logged into the Ubuntu server.

</p>
<p>
After examining SSH traffic, I exited the Ubuntu server to filter for DHCP traffic. I issued a new IP address from my VM using the command ipconfig /renew, which temporarily disconnected me for a few seconds. Upon reconnecting, the resulting traffic was captured in Wireshark.

</p>
<p>
To observe DNS traffic, I used the filter udp.port == 53 and the command nslookup. I wanted to see the results that are from looking up google.com and disney.com, two very popular sites.

</p>
<p>
To finish my lab, I decided to observe RDP traffic. The filter for Wireshark is tcp.port == 3389. There is non-stop traffic because RDP is constantly showing me a live stream from one computer to another (in my case, my computer accessing the VM that is hosted on Azure) and thus traffic is always transmitted.

<h2>What we learned </h2>

The purpose of this lab is to observe how different protocols and ports are used in network communication. Although it doesnâ€™t directly enable troubleshooting, it helps gather valuable information. Successful troubleshooting requires tools like Wireshark and the command line to understand network traffic flow.
